#Checking eligibility:

age = int(input("Enter your age"))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligibel to vote")

else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote")

#This program first takes the userâ€™s age as input. 
#Then, the if statement checks if the age is greater than or equal to 18 (the voting age).
#If the condition is True, the program displays a message indicating eligibility
#If the condition is False (age less than 18), the else block executes, and the program displays a message stating ineligibility.
